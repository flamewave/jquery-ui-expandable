   expanded/collapsed when the header row is clicked.

   item is expanded.

   expand(), and collapse() methods.

 - Bug fix: when using AJAX loading, items with a default state set to be expanded would not automatically load their
   content.
 - Updated all events to be fired using the _trigger() method of the widget factory. This included moving the
   "failedLoad" event outside of the "ajax" option to be a root-level option/event.
 - Changed the default animation to be "slide up" if it is available, otherwise use the default jQuery animation.
 - Streamlined the animation code for the expandos.

   "loadContent", "setContent", and "toggle" methods.
